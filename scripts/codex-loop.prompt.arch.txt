Goal: execute one concrete architecture improvement that the repo can validate now.

Rules for this iteration:
- Read `docs/architecture/NORTH_STAR.md` and `docs/architecture/BOUNDARIES.md` before code changes.
- Start by running `./scripts/check-checker-boundaries.sh` and use the report to choose one actionable violation/hotspot.
- Work solver-first and keep checker as thin orchestration (`WHAT` in solver, `WHERE` in checker).
- Implement one small, high-signal fix; avoid broad refactors in a single loop.
- Add or update focused tests for the changed behavior.
- Re-run `./scripts/check-checker-boundaries.sh` plus targeted tests for touched crates/files.
- Before starting new work, if any diff is left from the previous iteration, continue from that diff and include it in this iteration.
- End this iteration with exactly one coherent architecture-oriented commit and push it to main.
- Sync with main using `git pull --rebase origin main`, then push with `git push origin HEAD:main`.
- If there are no file changes, create an empty checkpoint commit with `git commit --allow-empty -m "chore(loop): iteration checkpoint"` and push it.
- Do not ask user questions; complete the iteration end-to-end.

Output summary must include:
- Architecture issue addressed
- Files changed and why
- Checks run with exact commands and outcomes
- Residual risk or next follow-up
