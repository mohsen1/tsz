Goal: execute one concrete architecture improvement that the repo can validate now.

Rules for this iteration:
- Read `docs/architecture/NORTH_STAR.md` and `docs/architecture/BOUNDARIES.md` before code changes.
- Start by running `./scripts/check-checker-boundaries.sh` and use the report to choose one actionable violation/hotspot.
- Work solver-first and keep checker as thin orchestration (`WHAT` in solver, `WHERE` in checker).
- Implement one small, high-signal fix; avoid broad refactors in a single loop.
- Add or update focused tests for the changed behavior.
- Re-run `./scripts/check-checker-boundaries.sh` plus targeted tests for touched crates/files.
- If improved without regressions, create one coherent architecture-oriented commit.
- Do not ask user questions; complete the iteration end-to-end.

Output summary must include:
- Architecture issue addressed
- Files changed and why
- Checks run with exact commands and outcomes
- Residual risk or next follow-up
