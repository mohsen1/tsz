Execute one high-impact architecture roadmap slice from docs/architecture/CRITIQUE.md.

Rules for this iteration:
- Work solver-first and keep checker as thin orchestration.
- Close one concrete roadmap item or a well-bounded sub-item.
- Update docs/architecture/CRITIQUE.md in the same iteration to mark completed/in-progress work.
- Add or update focused tests for the changed behavior.
- Run relevant tests and report exact commands and outcomes.
- End this iteration with exactly one coherent commit and push it to main.
- Sync with main using `git pull --rebase origin main`, then push with `git push origin HEAD:main`.
- If there are no file changes, create an empty checkpoint commit with `git commit --allow-empty -m "chore(loop): iteration checkpoint"` and push it.

Output summary must include:
- Roadmap item(s) advanced
- Doc status updates made
- Tests executed and results
- Risks or follow-up item
