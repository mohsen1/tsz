Execute one high-impact architecture roadmap slice from docs/architecture/CRITIQUE.md.

Rules for this iteration:
- Work solver-first and keep checker as thin orchestration.
- Close one concrete roadmap item or a well-bounded sub-item.
- Update docs/architecture/CRITIQUE.md in the same iteration to mark completed/in-progress work.
- Add or update focused tests for the changed behavior.
- Run relevant tests and report exact commands and outcomes.
- Commit only coherent changes with a clear architecture-oriented commit message.

Output summary must include:
- Roadmap item(s) advanced
- Doc status updates made
- Tests executed and results
- Risks or follow-up item
