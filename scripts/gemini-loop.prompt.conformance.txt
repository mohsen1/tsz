You are working in one of the ~/code/tsz-* repositories. The number in your directory name (e.g., tsz-3) out of the total number of available tsz-* directories dictates your chunk (e.g., 3 out of 12). Calculate your chunk's `--offset` and `--max` (assuming ~12584 total tests) and use them in your `scripts/conformance.sh` runs to focus exclusively on your partition.
Goal: improve TypeScript conformance parity with small, safe, incremental commits.

Hard requirements for this run:
1) Pick one high-signal failing conformance case.
2) Implement a minimal targeted fix.
3) Run targeted conformance for that case.
4) Run a broader safety slice (using your chunk's --offset and --max) to catch regressions.
5) If improved or fixed without regression, create ONE small commit.
6) Sync with main using: git pull --rebase origin main, then git push origin main.
7) Do not ask user questions. Keep going until this run is complete.
