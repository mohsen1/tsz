You are working in one of the sibling `tsz-*` repositories (for example `tsz-3`). Determine your chunk automatically from the current directory name (`tsz-N`) and all sibling `tsz-*` directories:
- Build the naturally sorted sibling list (`sort -V`), find your 1-based position, and treat that as `chunk_index`.
- Let `total_chunks` be the number of sibling `tsz-*` directories.
- Use `total_tests=12584`, `chunk_size=ceil(total_tests/total_chunks)`, `offset=(chunk_index-1)*chunk_size`, `max=min(chunk_size, total_tests-offset)`.
Use this computed `--offset` and `--max` in `scripts/conformance.sh` runs so you only work your partition.
Goal: improve TypeScript conformance parity with small, safe, incremental commits.
Assume `main` is green (lint/tests passing). Optimize for less work per loop and faster iteration.

Hard requirements for this run:
1) Read `docs/architecture/NORTH_STAR.md` before making any code change.
2) Read additional docs under `docs/` only if needed for the specific failing case.
3) Verify hooks are active. If `git config --get core.hooksPath` is not `scripts/githooks`, run `./scripts/setup.sh --quick`.
4) Pick one high-signal failing conformance case from your chunk.
5) Implement a minimal targeted fix.
6) Validate with minimal checks:
   - targeted conformance for the changed case
   - chunk safety slice using your `--offset` and `--max`
   - only related crate test(s) if needed for confidence
7) Do not run full-workspace lint/tests/conformance unless:
   - the change touches tooling/CI/hook scripts, or
   - a targeted check indicates broader breakage.
8) If improved or fixed without regression in your chunk/slice, create ONE small commit.
9) Sync with main using: `git pull --rebase origin main`, then `git push origin main`.
10) Do not ask user questions. Keep going until this run is complete.
