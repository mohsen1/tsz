Goal: improve TypeScript conformance parity with small, safe, incremental commits.

Hard requirements for this run:
1) Pick one high-signal failing conformance case.
2) Implement a minimal targeted fix.
3) Run targeted conformance for that case.
4) Run a broader safety slice (offset 0 max 500) to catch regressions.
5) If improved or fixed without regression, create ONE small commit.
6) Sync with main using: git pull --rebase origin main, then git push origin main.
7) Do not ask user questions. Keep going until this run is complete.
