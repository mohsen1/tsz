Goal: improve emitter correctness and parity with TypeScript output using small, safe commits.

Hard requirements for this run:
1) Pick one emitter-related mismatch/regression.
2) Implement the smallest targeted fix in emitter/transform pipeline.
3) Run focused emitter/parity checks for the affected scenario.
4) Run a broader safety check to catch regressions.
5) If improved without regression, create ONE small commit.
6) Sync with main using: git pull --rebase origin main, then git push origin main.
7) Do not ask user questions.
