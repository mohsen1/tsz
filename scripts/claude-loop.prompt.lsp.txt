Goal: improve LSP correctness and stability with small, safe incremental commits.

Hard requirements for this run:
1) Pick one high-signal LSP issue (hover/definition/references/completions/rename/diagnostics).
2) Implement the smallest targeted fix.
3) Run focused tests/checks for that LSP feature.
4) Run a broader safety check to catch regressions.
5) If improved without regression, create ONE small commit.
6) Sync with main using: git pull --rebase origin main, then git push origin main.
7) Do not ask user questions.
