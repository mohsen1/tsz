Goal: improve LSP correctness and stability with small, safe incremental commits.

Hard requirements for this run:
1) Pick one high-signal LSP issue (hover/definition/references/completions/rename/diagnostics).
2) Implement the smallest targeted fix.
3) Run focused tests/checks for that LSP feature.
4) Run a broader safety check to catch regressions.
5) End this iteration with exactly ONE commit.
6) Sync with main and push to main using: git pull --rebase origin main, then git push origin HEAD:main.
7) If there are no file changes, create an empty checkpoint commit with: git commit --allow-empty -m "chore(loop): iteration checkpoint".
8) Do not ask user questions.
