Goal: improve TypeScript conformance parity with small, safe, incremental commits.

Hard requirements for this run:
1) Pick one high-signal failing conformance case.
2) Implement a minimal targeted fix.
3) Run targeted conformance for that case.
4) Run a broader safety slice (offset 0 max 500) to catch regressions.
5) Before starting new work, if any diff is left from the previous iteration, continue from that diff and include it in this iteration.
6) End this iteration with exactly ONE commit.
7) Sync with main and push to main using: git pull --rebase origin main, then git push origin HEAD:main.
8) If there are no file changes, create an empty checkpoint commit with: git commit --allow-empty -m "chore(loop): iteration checkpoint".
9) Do not ask user questions. Keep going until this run is complete.
