Goal: improve TypeScript conformance parity with small, safe, incremental commits.

Hard requirements for this run:
1) Pick one high-signal failing conformance case.
2) Implement a minimal targeted fix.
3) Run targeted conformance for that case.
4) Run a broader safety slice (offset 0 max 500) to catch regressions.
5) End this iteration with exactly ONE commit.
6) Sync with main and push to main using: git pull --rebase origin main, then git push origin HEAD:main.
7) If there are no file changes, create an empty checkpoint commit with: git commit --allow-empty -m "chore(loop): iteration checkpoint".
8) Do not ask user questions. Keep going until this run is complete.
