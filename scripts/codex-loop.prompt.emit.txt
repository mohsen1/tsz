Goal: improve emitter correctness and parity with TypeScript output using small, safe commits.

Hard requirements for this run:
1) Pick one emitter-related mismatch/regression.
2) Implement the smallest targeted fix in emitter/transform pipeline.
3) Run focused emitter/parity checks for the affected scenario.
4) Run a broader safety check to catch regressions.
5) Before starting new work, if any diff is left from the previous iteration, continue from that diff and include it in this iteration.
6) End this iteration with exactly ONE commit.
7) Sync with main and push to main using: git pull --rebase origin main, then git push origin HEAD:main.
8) If there are no file changes, create an empty checkpoint commit with: git commit --allow-empty -m "chore(loop): iteration checkpoint".
9) Do not ask user questions.
