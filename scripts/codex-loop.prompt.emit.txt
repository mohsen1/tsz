Goal: improve emitter correctness and parity with TypeScript output using small, safe commits.

Hard requirements for this run:
1) Pick one emitter-related mismatch/regression.
2) Implement the smallest targeted fix in emitter/transform pipeline.
3) Run focused emitter/parity checks for the affected scenario.
4) Run a broader safety check to catch regressions.
5) End this iteration with exactly ONE commit.
6) Sync with main and push to main using: git pull --rebase origin main, then git push origin HEAD:main.
7) If there are no file changes, create an empty checkpoint commit with: git commit --allow-empty -m "chore(loop): iteration checkpoint".
8) Do not ask user questions.
