# LSP session notes

## 2026-02-22

Completed in this pass:
- Fixed node_modules package specifier normalization for extensionless `index.d.ts` roots (`bar/index.d.ts` -> `bar`) while preserving `.d.mts -> .mjs` and `.d.cts -> .cjs` behavior.
- Added package.json `main/module` entrypoint-aware module specifier fallback logic.
- Fixed `rootDirs` candidate selection to choose the shortest relative module specifier across root pair combinations.
- Added focused unit tests in `crates/tsz-lsp/src/project_operations.rs` for the above cases.
- Fixed quick-info hover parity for contextually-typed function-expression parameters in type-asserted callsites.
- Added focused hover unit test in `crates/tsz-lsp/tests/hover_tests.rs` for contextual parameter quick info (`(parameter) bb: number`).

Investigated but punted:
- `TypeScript/tests/cases/fourslash/autoImportModuleNone1.ts`: still returns unexpected completion `x` in `module:none` + `target:es5` scenario.
  Reason: auto-import gating paths were added for tsconfig/inferred/fourslash directive contexts, but this failure appears to involve completion entry surfacing outside current gate points and needs a deeper completion pipeline trace.
- `TypeScript/tests/cases/fourslash/autoImportCompletionExportListAugmentation{1,2,3,4}.ts`: missing `container` class member snippet completion.
  Reason: likely requires deeper augmentation/merged-export symbol indexing behavior beyond module specifier generation.
- `TypeScript/tests/cases/fourslash/arityErrorAfterStringCompletions.ts`: no completions offered inside string literal argument with contextual `keyof` generic constraint.
  Reason: needs a dedicated string-literal contextual completion pipeline (argument-context extraction + generic constraint/keyof evaluation) beyond current object/member completion paths.
