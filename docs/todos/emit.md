# Emitter TODO — Skipped / Investigated Issues

## Pattern Analysis (JS-only mode, baseline 9118/13623 = 66.9%)

### Fixed This Session
- **Orphaned comments at end of class body** (+27 tests): Comments after erased members
  leaked past the closing `}`. Fixed by advancing `comment_emit_idx` past remaining
  comments inside the class body boundary after the member loop.

- **Semicolons in class bodies** (+4 tests): `SEMICOLON_CLASS_ELEMENT` nodes were
  incorrectly marked as erased in the emitter (declarations.rs). Additionally, the
  parser's `parse_class_members()` consumed trailing semicolons unconditionally via
  `parse_optional(SemicolonToken)` after each member, which ate the second `;` when
  consecutive semicolons appeared. Fixed in both emitter (stop erasing) and parser
  (skip trailing-semicolon consumption when member is itself a `SEMICOLON_CLASS_ELEMENT`).

### High-Impact Patterns (Not Yet Fixed)

1. **class_iife** (~205 tests, ~123 unique): Classes with downlevel transforms expected
   to emit IIFE wrappers (e.g. `var Foo = (function() { ... })();`). tsz emits ES6
   class syntax instead. Requires implementing the ES5 class transform pipeline.

2. **extra_comment (between-member)** (~90 remaining tests): Comments between erased
   and non-erased class members still leak through `emit_comments_before_pos()`. The
   aggressive fix (skipping to next member pos) regressed 15 tests because it ate
   leading comments of subsequent non-erased members. Needs a smarter heuristic that
   distinguishes "trailing comment of erased member" from "leading comment of next
   member" — possibly using line gap or blank-line detection.

3. **export_pattern** (~101 tests): Various export rewriting mismatches — missing
   `Object.defineProperty(exports, ...)`, incorrect `exports.X = ...` patterns,
   module system transform issues.

4. **missing_helper** (~99 tests): Missing runtime helper functions like `__decorate`,
   `__extends`, `__awaiter`, `__generator`, `__spreadArray` etc. Requires implementing
   the helper injection system.

5. **decorator** (~70 tests): Decorator transform not implemented. Related to
   `missing_helper` — decorators need both the transform and `__decorate` helper.

6. **let_var** (~49 tests): `let`/`const` → `var` downlevel transform not applied
   when targeting ES5.

7. **enum_iife** (~35 tests): Enum declarations not emitted as IIFEs
   (`var Color; (function(Color) { ... })(Color || (Color = {}));`).

8. **namespace/module IIFE** (~30 tests): Similar to enum — namespace/module blocks
   need IIFE wrapping.

9. **async_transform** (~25 tests): `async`/`await` downlevel transform to
   `__awaiter`/`__generator` pattern.

10. **computed_property** (~20 tests): Computed property names in class/object
    downlevel transform.

11. **"use strict" for AMD/outFile modules** (~1 test): AMD modules should emit
    `"use strict"` inside the `define()` callback, but the test runner's outFile
    handling interacts with the compiler's output in complex ways. Needs careful
    investigation of `module_wrapper.rs` and `cli-transpiler.ts` interaction.

12. **"use strict" for module=preserve** (~3 tests): The test runner adds `"use strict"`
    for JS inputs when module kind includes Preserve (code 200). This is a test
    runner behavior (`cli-transpiler.ts` lines 422-426), not an emitter bug per se.

13. **Comment preservation on erased constructs** (~13 tests): Comments like
    `// error` and `// no error` attached to type-only declarations are emitted
    even when the declaration is erased. The emitter's `skip_comments_for_erased_node`
    doesn't fully suppress comments that are interleaved between erased and
    non-erased members.

14. **accessor keyword transform** (~34 tests): The `accessor` keyword on class
    fields requires a downlevel transform to getter/setter pairs. Not yet implemented.

15. **`using` statement disposal helpers** (~26 tests): The `using` declaration
    requires `__addDisposableResource` and related helpers. Not yet implemented.
