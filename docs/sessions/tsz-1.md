# Session tsz-1: Conformance Improvements

**Started**: 2026-02-04 (Ninth iteration)
**Status**: Active
**Goal**: Continue reducing conformance failures from 46 to lower

## Previous Session Achievements (2026-02-04)
- ✅ Fixed 3 test expectations
- ✅ Conformance: 51 → 46 failing tests (-5)

## Current Focus

### Immediate Tasks
1. Review remaining 46 failing tests
2. Focus on simple test expectation corrections
3. Use tsz-tracing skill for complex debugging when needed

### Documented Complex Issues (Deferred)
- TS2540 readonly properties (TypeKey::Lazy handling - architectural blocker)
- Contextual typing for arrow function parameters
- Numeric enum assignability (bidirectional with number)

### Strategy
- Timebox investigations to 30 minutes
- Document blockers quickly and move on
- Focus on achievable wins

## Status: ACTIVE
Ready to continue conformance work.
