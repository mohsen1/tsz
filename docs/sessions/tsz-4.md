# Session tsz-4

## Current Work

Exploring ignored tests to identify a tractable starting point. Found 75 ignored tests in `checker_state_tests.rs` across these categories:

- Module resolution (TS2307): ~10 tests
- Missing identifiers (TS2304): ~20 tests
- Flow narrowing: ~15 tests
- Conditional types/Redux patterns: ~10 tests
- Property access (TS2339, TS4111): ~8 tests
- Split accessors: ~2 tests
- Abstract classes: ~3 tests

Asking Gemini for guidance on which area would be most productive to tackle.
