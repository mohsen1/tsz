**Started**: 2026-02-05
**Status**: ⚠️ SUPERSEDED by tsz-3

## Superseded By

This session has been superseded by **tsz-3** (CFA Refinement & Advanced Features).

All unique content from this session has been merged into the new tsz-3 session, which combines:
- The architectural investigation needed for Nested Discriminants
- The edge case fixes from this session
- The completed assertion functions from previous tsz-3

## Original Goal (Historical)

Implement advanced Control Flow Analysis features to achieve 100% TypeScript parity:
1. Bidirectional narrowing for reference equality
2. Assertion functions integration
3. Deeply nested discriminants
4. Edge case fixes

## Status

This session is no longer active. See `docs/sessions/tsz-3.md` for the active continuation of this work.
