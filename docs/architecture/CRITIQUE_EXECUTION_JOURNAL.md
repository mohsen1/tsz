- [x] Migrated  JSDoc template type-param construction to solver  API.
- [x] Migrated `function_type.rs` JSDoc template TypeParam construction from `intern(TypeKey::TypeParameter(...))` to `types.type_param(...)` to enforce solver-constructor-only path.
- [x] Migrated `type_checking_utilities.rs` `TypeKey::KeyOf` direct interning to `types.keyof(...)` constructor API.
- [x] Migrated query-boundary tests to checker-safe constructor APIs by replacing `TypeKey::TypeParameter` and `TypeKey::KeyOf` calls with `types.type_param(...)` / `types.keyof(...)`.
- [x] Migrated `enum_member_cache_tests.rs` to avoid `TypeKey` construction/inspection by using `type_queries::get_enum_def_id(...)` for enum-member assertions.
- [x] Added `TypeInterner::this_type()` and migrated `lower.rs` constructor paths (`ThisType`, `TypeParameter`, `IndexAccess`, `Lazy`, `TypeQuery`, `KeyOf`, `ReadonlyType`) to public helpers.
