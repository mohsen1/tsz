# Aspirations

This folder contains documentation for **future features and goals** that are not yet fully implemented but guide the project's direction.

## Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [PERFORMANCE_ASPIRATIONS.md](./PERFORMANCE_ASPIRATIONS.md) | Performance targets, Data-Oriented Design principles, and optimization goals |
| [SOUND_MODE_ASPIRATIONS.md](./SOUND_MODE_ASPIRATIONS.md) | Optional strict type checking mode that catches bugs TypeScript allows |

## Status Legend

- ✅ **Implemented** - Verified in codebase
- ⚠️ **Partial** - Partially implemented, needs completion  
- ❌ **Aspirational** - Planned but not yet implemented

## Contributing

When adding to aspirations:
1. Be specific about what the feature would do
2. Include code examples where possible
3. Note implementation locations if known
4. Link to related documentation

Aspirations are not promises - they're goals that guide architectural decisions.
