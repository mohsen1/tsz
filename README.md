# Project Zang

Project Zang is a performance-first TypeScript compiler in Rust.[^1]
The goal is a correct, fast, drop-in replacement for `tsc`, with both native and WASM targets.

TypeScript is intentionally unsound. Zang keeps a sound core solver and layers a compatibility
engine on top to match TypeScript behavior while preserving correctness where possible.


## Status
This project is not ready for general use yet. The interface and distribution are in progress.

## Planned distribution
- `tsz` CLI (native binaries for major operating systems)
- Rust crate `tsz` (library + CLI)
- WASM bindings
- npm package `@tsz/tsz` (primary)
- compat package `@tsz/tsc` that exposes a `tsc` executable so tooling can swap without noticing
- Playground
