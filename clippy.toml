# TSZ clippy policy
# Aligned with docs/architecture/NORTH_STAR.md:
#  - thin orchestration in checker/lsp, strict solver ownership of type logic
#  - explicit, maintainable code paths for pipeline correctness
#  - strong readability and architectural boundaries

# Keep complex files and impls visible during review
# (not an absolute ban; architectural intent can justify exceptions with context).
