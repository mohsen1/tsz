//! Tests for TS2352 type-assertion overlap with the `object` primitive
//! and the `{}` empty object type.
//!
//! Conformance test:
//! `TypeScript/tests/cases/compiler/genericWithNoConstraintComparableWithCurlyCurly.ts`
//!
//! Before this fix, `{} as T` where `T extends object | null | undefined`
//! emitted a false-positive TS2352 because the assertion-overlap check
//! returned false when both sides had no extractable properties:
//! `types_have_common_properties_relaxed` short-circuits on the
//! "both empty" branch. tsc treats the `object` primitive as overlapping
//! with any object-like type, and walks a `TypeParameter`'s constraint
//! when the source is the empty object type `{}`.
//!
//! Two narrow rules added in `types_are_comparable_for_assertion_inner`:
//!   1. `object` primitive ↔ Object/Array/Tuple/Callable/Function/Intersection
//!      → comparable.
//!   2. `{}` (empty object: no required props, no index sigs) ↔
//!      `TypeParameter` with constraint → recurse against the constraint.
//!
//! The "narrow to {}" gating is important: fully unwrapping any source's
//! type-parameter constraint would over-permit assertions like
//! `B as T extends A` (genericTypeAssertions4.ts).
