# tsz-1 Conformance Improvement Log
Started: 2026-02-15T18:10:00-05:00

- 18:10:00: Binary-text detection update committed to this session (TS1490/TS1005 focus). TransportStream.ts now emits TS1490 via parser binary check.

- 18:20:00: Committed + rebased + pushed `ce9a25427` (Improve binary text detection for TS1490). Verified `TransportStream.ts` now passes and TS1005 slice remains same count (94 missing / 55 extra) at this stage.

- 18:26:14: Added TS1005 recovery in parse_decorated_class_expression (non-class decorators in expression context). `decoratorOnArrowFunction.ts` and `decoratorOnFunctionExpression.ts` now pass in focused TS conformance; TS1005 slice all-missing count unchanged at 20, extra TS1005 count moved to 49. Prepared commit pending.

- 18:35:00: Committed `127e53918` and completed required sync (`git pull --rebase origin main` then push). Local HEAD now at `0a51f9bc0` after rebase + push.

- 18:32:54: Added object-literal semicolon EOF recovery in `parse_object_literal` (emit comma expected for semicolon-at-EOF, break). `objectLiteralWithSemicolons4.ts` now passes; TS1005 all-missing count dropped to 91, close-to-passing list stable at 85.

- 18:37:10: Committed `e412790ed` and completed sync (`git pull --rebase origin main` then push), final pushed commit now `f0d6b1931`.
- 18:46:53: Fixed object-binding keyword identifier parsing in binding patterns (`parse_object_binding_pattern` + `parse_binding_element_name`), passing 4 `objectBindingPatternKeywordIdentifiers*` tests.
- 18:56:57: Fixed parser regex-literal recovery in parse_regex_literal to emit TS1005 for unmatched regex substructures; passes parser579071.ts.
- 18:58:00: Committed ed79238b0 and pushed (`Fix parser recovery for incomplete regex groups`), parser579071 passes; TS1005 all-missing reduced to 14.
- 19:02:22: Added shared type-member separator recovery (`parse_type_member_separator_with_asi`) and applied to interface/type-literal member loops. `objectTypeLiteralSyntax2.ts` now passes; TS1005 missing reduced by 1 (14→13 in analyze output).
- 19:04:20: Ran focused conformance (`objectTypeLiteralSyntax2.ts`) and got pass. Committed and pushed `2a23536db` (rebased to `1554a8c18`), reducing TS1005 missing list by one in analyze output.
- 20:36:35: Fixed conditional `look_ahead_is_arrow_function` parse to avoid treating parenthesized false-branch expressions as arrow return types. `parserArrowFunctionExpression6.ts` now passes; focused TS1005 false-positive count improved.
- 20:50:10: Reworked `<<` primary-token handling in `parse_primary_expression` to emit TS1109 for ambiguous generic assertion ambiguity case; `ambiguousGenericAssertion1.ts` now passes (100%). TS1005 slice run (`--error-code 1005 --max 400`) remained at 358/400 passed with expected top mismatches unchanged.
